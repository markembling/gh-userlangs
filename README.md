GitHub Language Statistics
==========================

This is a small Flask web app which uses the GitHub API to determine what languages are used inside your repositories.

It displays graphs which give the following:

 - Languages in all your repositories as a percentage of bytes (i.e. volume of code)
 - Number of appearances for each language (i.e. how many repositories does the language appear in)

It also gives a table with all this information.

Visit <http://ghuserlangs.markembling.info> to see it in action.
